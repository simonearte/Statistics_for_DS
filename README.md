# Statistics_for_DS
## Project Description 
As a data scientist, you must be able to
understand and reproduce innovations
in the field, which are typically described in scientific papers

### Understanding
Means being able to comprehend and communicate to others
theoretical and methodological innovation, using appropriate formal statistical
language

### Reproducing
Means being able to re implement portions of methods and
algorithms, or to re implement portions of the tests and experimental
validation, using the R programming language

## Paper's ABSTRACT
In credit scoring, it is well known that AUC (the area under curve) can
be calculated geometrically, by the probability of a correct ranking of a
good and bad pair, and by the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum statistic. This threeway
equivalence was first present by Hanley and McNeil in 1982 without
considering tied scores and without giving analytical proofs. In this
paper,we extend the three-way equivalence to the casewith tied scores
and provide analytic proofs for the three-way equivalence
